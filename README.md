# elliptic_quaternions_and_elliptic_numbers_toolbox
A MATLAB toolbox that performs advanced algebraic calculations in the algebra of elliptic quaternions and elliptic numbers has been developed.

In this project presents a toolbox developed in MATLAB version 0.1 for elliptic numbers and elliptic quaternions. Elliptic numbers and elliptic quaternions are numerical systems for solving mathematical and physical problems. On the other hand, as shown below Figure, elliptic quaternions are a general form of elliptic numbers, reduced biquaternions (commutative quaternions), complex numbers, and real numbers. This generalization offers a more expansive framework, enhancing the versatility and applicability of the developed toolbox.
