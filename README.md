# elliptic_quaternions_and_elliptic_numbers_toolbox
This project presents 0.1 version of the MATLAB toolbox developed for computations in elliptic quaternions, elliptic numbers, and matrices with those components. Elliptic quaternions and elliptic numbers are quite useful numerical systems in solving mathematical and physical problems with elliptical behavior. On the other hand, as shown below in the Figure, elliptic quaternions are a generalization of elliptic numbers, reduced biquaternions (commutative quaternions), complex numbers, and real numbers. This generalization offers a more expansive framework, enhancing the versatility and applicability of the developed toolbox. Moreover, this toolbox also includes some image-processing functions.
